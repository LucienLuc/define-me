{"text_snippet": {"content": "The lipids are a chemically diverse group of hydrocarbons.\nThe property they all share is insolubility in water, which is\ndue to the presence of many nonpolar covalent bonds. As we\nsaw in Chapter 2, nonpolar hydrocarbon molecules are hydrophobic and preferentially aggregate among themselves,\naway from water, which is polar. When these nonpolar molecules are sufficiently close together, weak but additive van\nder Waals forces hold them together. These huge macromolecular aggregations are not polymers in a strict chemical\nsense, since their units (lipid molecules) are not held together\nby covalent bonds, as are, for example, the amino acids in\nproteins. But they can be considered polymers of individual\nlipid units.\nIn this section, we will describe the different types of\nlipids. Lipids have a number of roles in living organisms:\nFats and oils store energy.\nPhospholipids play important structural roles in cell\nmembranes.\nThe carotenoids help plants capture light energy.\nSteroids and modified fatty acids play regulatory roles\nas hormones and vitamins.\nThe fat in animal bodies serves as thermal insulation.\nA lipid coating around nerves acts as electrical insulation.\nOil or wax on the surfaces of skin, fur, and feathers\nrepels water.\nFats and oils store energy\nChemically, fats and oils are triglycerides, also known as simple lipids. Triglycerides that are solid at room temperature\n(20°C) are called fats; those that are liquid at room temperature are called oils. Triglycerides are composed of two types\nof building blocks: fatty acids and glycerol. Glycerol is a small\nmolecule with three hydroxyl (—OH) groups (an alcohol). A\nfatty acid is made up of a long nonpolar hydrocarbon chain\nand a polar carboxyl group (—COOH). A triglyceride contains three fatty acid molecules and one molecule of glycerol."}, "annotations": []}
