The lipids are a chemically diverse group of hydrocarbons.
The property they all share is insolubility in water, which is
due to the presence of many nonpolar covalent bonds. As we
saw in Chapter 2, nonpolar hydrocarbon molecules are hydrophobic and preferentially aggregate among themselves,
away from water, which is polar. When these nonpolar molecules are sufficiently close together, weak but additive van
der Waals forces hold them together. These huge macromolecular aggregations are not polymers in a strict chemical
sense, since their units (lipid molecules) are not held together
by covalent bonds, as are, for example, the amino acids in
proteins. But they can be considered polymers of individual
lipid units.
In this section, we will describe the different types of
lipids. Lipids have a number of roles in living organisms:
 Fats and oils store energy.
 Phospholipids play important structural roles in cell
membranes.
 The carotenoids help plants capture light energy.
 Steroids and modified fatty acids play regulatory roles
as hormones and vitamins.
 The fat in animal bodies serves as thermal insulation.
 A lipid coating around nerves acts as electrical insulation.
 Oil or wax on the surfaces of skin, fur, and feathers
repels water.
Fats and oils store energy
Chemically, fats and oils are triglycerides, also known as simple lipids. Triglycerides that are solid at room temperature
(20°C) are called fats; those that are liquid at room temperature are called oils. Triglycerides are composed of two types
of building blocks: fatty acids and glycerol. Glycerol is a small
molecule with three hydroxyl (—OH) groups (an alcohol). A
fatty acid is made up of a long nonpolar hydrocarbon chain
and a polar carboxyl group (—COOH). A triglyceride contains three fatty acid molecules and one molecule of glycerol.
