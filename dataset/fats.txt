The carboxyl group of a fatty acid can form a covalent bond
with the hydroxyl group of glycerol, resulting a functional
group called an ester and water (Figure 3.18).
The three fatty acids in a triglyceride molecule need not
all have the same hydrocarbon chain length or structure:
 In saturated fatty acids, all the bonds between the carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain are single bonds—
there are no double bonds. That is, all the bonds are saturated with hydrogen atoms (Figure 3.19a). These fatty
acid molecules are relatively rigid and straight, and they
pack together tightly, like pencils in a box.
 In unsaturated fatty acids, the hydrocarbon chain contains one or more double bonds. Oleic acid, for example,
is a monounsaturated fatty acid that has one double bond
near the middle of the hydrocarbon chain, which causes
a kink in the molecule (Figure 3.19b). Some fatty acids
have more than one double bond—are polyunsaturated—
and have multiple kinks. These kinks prevent the molecules from packing together tightly.
The kinks in fatty acid molecules are important in determining the fluidity and melting point of a lipid. The triglycerides
of animal fats tend to have many long-chain saturated fatty
acids, packed tightly together; these fats are usually solids at
room temperature and have a high melting point. The
triglycerides of plants, such as corn oil, tend to have short or
unsaturated fatty acids. Because of their kinks, these fatty
acids pack together poorly and have a low melting point, and
these triglycerides are usually liquids at room temperature.
Fats and oils are marvelous storehouses for energy. When
they take in excess food, many animal species deposit fat
droplets in their cells as a means of storing energy. Some
plant species, such as olives, avocados, sesame, castor beans,
and all nuts, have substantial amounts of lipids in their seeds

All bonds between
carbon atoms are single
in a saturated fatty acid
(carbon chain is straight).
A double bond between
two carbons makes an
unsaturated fatty acid
(carbon chain has kinks).
The straight chain allows a molecule to
pack tightly among other similar
molecules. Kinks prevent close packing.

This energy can be tapped by people who eat these plant oils
or use them for fuel. Indeed, the famous German engineer
Rudolf Diesel used peanut oil to power one of his early automobile engines in 1900.
